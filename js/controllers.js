It can currently generate memes, as well as pull files from my personal computer (only works for me!). To get access to the Bot, you need to have <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Wild_Doge\" class=\"bbcode_url\">this account<\/a> follow you on twitter. Just contact me if you want access, or just follow the bot itself. I'll probably just follow you back via the account. <br \/>\n <br \/>\nIf you don't feel like reading, these pictures should give you a good idea on how to get started. <br \/>\n <a href='http:\/\/s26.postimg.org\/atqr6y46x\/2qkpfyg_1.png'> <img src=\"http:\/\/s26.postimg.org\/atqr6y46x\/2qkpfyg_1.png\" alt=\"2qkpfyg_1.png\" class=\"thumbnail bbcode_img\" \/><\/a> <a href='http:\/\/s26.postimg.org\/6lvyy72rd\/17pxdv_1.png'> <img src=\"http:\/\/s26.postimg.org\/6lvyy72rd\/17pxdv_1.png\" alt=\"17pxdv_1.png\" class=\"thumbnail bbcode_img\" \/><\/a> <br \/>\n <br \/>\nTo use the bot, the syntax is as follows. <br \/>\n <b>To call the doge<\/b> <br \/>\nSimple write 'doge appears!' in any part of your tweet. Doge will appear. The idea is that you can call the bot into any conversation with these keywords (you dont have to though). For example, the following tweets will work: <br \/>\n <span style=\"color:blue\">doge appears!<\/span> <br \/>\n <span style=\"color:blue\">a wild doge appears!<\/span> <br \/>\n <span style=\"color:blue\">my buddy doge appears!<\/span> <br \/>\n <span style=\"color:blue\">@friend look, my doge appears!<\/span> <br \/>\n <br \/>\n <b>To generate a meme<\/b> <br \/>\nTo generate a meme, follow this syntax. Substitute anything in blue with the actual value you want. Remember, you can call this syntax as a reply to a conversation! <br \/>\ndoge generate <span style=\"color:blue\">memename<\/span>, <span style=\"color:blue\">line one<\/span>, <span style=\"color:blue\"> line two<\/span> <br \/>\nAs you can see, there is space to specify line one and line two of the meme. But what is 'memename' you may ask? Well, that specifies what picture to put the words on. The following are all supported currently:\n <ul class=\"bbcode_list\">\n <li>doge<\/li>\n <li>henry<\/li>\n <li>steve<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHere are examples: <br \/>\n <span style=\"color:blue\">doge generate henry, i like, turtles<\/span> <br \/>\n <span style=\"color:blue\">doge generate doge, i like, turtles<\/span> <br \/>\n <span style=\"color:blue\">doge generate i like, turtles<\/span> <span style=\"color:red\">(assumes you want doge meme)<\/span>","numComments":0,"redirectType":"","thumb":"dogebot.png","url":null};
